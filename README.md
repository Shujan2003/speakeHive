# SpeakHive
I have built this App using Flutter, Firebase Authentication, and Firestore. It allows students to submit complaints either with their name or anonymously, and admins can view/manage those complaints.
In colleges, students often hesitate to raise complaints due to fear of being identified. I wanted to solve this by providing a digital platform where students can submit grievances easily and anonymously if they wish.
